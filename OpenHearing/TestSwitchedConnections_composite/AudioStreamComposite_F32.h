//
// This is a base class intended to provide an interface (and some common functionality) for derived AudioStreamComposite_F32
// classes that are actually employed by the user.
//
// The idea is that an AudioStreamComposite_F32 is a composite class that instantiates and manages a whole chain of 
// AudioStream_F32 audio-processing objects.  One can simply instantiate an AudioStreamComposite_F32 and all of the constituant
// objects and connections are created.  The only thing left to do is connect the final output.

    //instance is deleted, AudioStream does not remove the instance from its lists.  So, it has stale pointers
